BattleCity is a (very limited) clone of the 1985 arcade game "[Battle City](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_City)" by Namco for the Famicom game console. There were many clones of this game, for example, "Tank 1990" for ZX Spectrum computers, etc.

Written in a couple of days. This was my first project written in [daScript](https://dascript.org/), my first project for [DasBox](https://github.com/imp5imp5/dasbox), and my first project using the [Entity Component System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entity_component_system) (ECS) pattern.

[DasBox Portable](https://github.com/imp5imp5/dasbox/releases) is required to run this game. Tested and works properly in DasBox Portable v0.1.55 (earlier versions have DESC bug and game crashes). Just go to the [DasBox releases](https://github.com/imp5imp5/dasbox/releases) page, download the **dasbox_portable.zip** (5 MB) file, unzip it somewhere on your disk, open that folder, create a "projects" folder next to the dasbox.exe file, create a "BattleCity" folder inside projects, and place "battlecity_main.das" file and "res" folder into it. Then run dasbox.exe, select "BattleCity" and press Enter.

In "BattleCity" use the arrow keys on your keyboard to drive and the Space key to shoot.
